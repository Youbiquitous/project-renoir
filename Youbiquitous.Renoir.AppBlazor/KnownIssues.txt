The following are known issues at the time of the first deploy to the Github repo.

1) In release/roadmap editors, when adding a new section and moving it up order numbers are screwed up. 
   Adding a new row and saving usually fixes it.

2) The title of the modal presenting the plain text version of the documents doesn't appear all the time.
   To be investigated.
